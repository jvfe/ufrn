  abstract = {The past few years have seen significant advances in the study of complex microbial communities associated with the evolution of sequencing technologies and increasing adoption of whole genome shotgun sequencing methods over the once more traditional Amplicon-based methods. Although these advances have broadened the horizon of meta-omic analyses in planetary health, human health, and ecology from simple sample composition studies to comprehensive taxonomic and metabolic profiles, there are still significant challenges in processing these data. First, there is a widespread lack of standardization in data processing, including software choices and the ease of installing and running attendant software. This can lead to several inconsistencies, making comparing results across studies and reproducing original results difficult. We argue that these drawbacks are especially evident in metatranscriptomic analysis, with most analyses relying on ad hoc scripts instead of pipelines implemented in workflow managers. Additional challenges rely on integrating meta-omic data, since methods have to consider the biases in the library preparation and sequencing methods and the technical noise that can arise from it. Here, we critically discuss the current limitations in metagenomics and metatranscriptomics methods with a view to catalyze future innovations in the field of Planetary Health, ecology, and allied fields of life sciences. We highlight possible solutions for these constraints to bring about more standardization, with ease of installation, high performance, and reproducibility as guiding principles.},

Specifically, the combination of large-scale diverse datasets and pretrained transformers has emerged as a promising approach for developing foundation models. Drawing parallels between language and cellular biology (in which texts comprise words; similarly, cells are defined by genes), our study probes the applicability of foundation models to advance cellular biology and genetic research. Using burgeoning single-cell sequencing data, we have constructed a foundation model for single-cell biology, scGPT, based on a generative pretrained transformer across a repository of over 33 million cells. Our findings illustrate that scGPT effectively distills critical biological insights concerning genes and cells. Through further adaptation of transfer learning, scGPT can be optimized to achieve superior performance across diverse downstream applications. This includes tasks such as cell type annotation, multi-batch integration, multi-omic integration, perturbation response prediction and gene network inference.},

EMT is induced by various signaling pathways, including TGF-{$\beta$}, BMP, Wnt--{$\beta$}-catenin, NOTCH, Shh, and receptor tyrosine kinases. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on MCF10A cells undergoing EMT by TGF-{$\beta$}1 stimulation. Our comprehensive analysis revealed that cells progress through EMT at different paces. Using pseudotime clustering reconstruction of gene-expression profiles during EMT, we found sequential and parallel activation of EMT signaling pathways. We also observed various transitional cellular states during EMT. We identified regulatory signaling nodes that drive EMT with the expression of important microRNAs and transcription factors. Using a random circuit perturbation methodology, we demonstrate that the NOTCH signaling pathway acts as a key driver of TGF-{$\beta$}--induced EMT. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the gene signatures of pseudotime clusters corresponding to the intermediate hybrid EMT state are associated with poor patient outcome. Overall, this study provides insight into context-specific drivers of cancer progression and highlights the complexities of the EMT process.},

  abstract = {Essential genes are so-called because they are crucial for organism perpetuation. Those genes are usually related to essential functions to cellular metabolism or multicellular homeostasis. Deleterious alterations on essential genes produce a spectrum of phenotypes in multicellular organisms. The effects range from the impairment of the fertilization process, disruption of fetal development, to loss of reproductive capacity. Essential genes are described as more evolutionarily conserved than non-essential genes. However, there is no consensus about the relationship between gene essentiality and gene age. Here, we identified essential genes in five model eukaryotic species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Mus musculus) and estimate their evolutionary ancestry and their network properties. We observed that essential genes, on average, are older than other genes in all species investigated. The relationship of network properties and gene essentiality convey with previous findings, showing essential genes as important nodes in biological networks. As expected, we also observed that essential orthologs shared by the five species evaluated here are old. However, all the species evaluated here have a specific set of young essential genes not shared among them. Additionally, these two groups of essential genes are involved with distinct biological functions, suggesting two sets of essential genes: (i) a set of old essential genes common to all the evaluated species, regulating basic cellular functions, and (ii) a set of young essential genes exclusive to each species, which perform specific essential functions in each species.},

We compared the relative abundance distributions obtained with the two sequencing strategies and then tested their capability to distinguish the experimental conditions. The results showed that 16S rRNA gene sequencing detects only part of the gut microbiota community revealed by shotgun sequencing. Specifically, when a sufficient number of reads is available, Shotgun sequencing has more power to identify less abundant taxa than 16S sequencing. Finally, we showed that the less abundant genera detected only by shotgun sequencing are biologically meaningful, being able to discriminate between the experimental conditions as much as the more abundant genera detected by both sequencing strategies.},

  abstract = {Background Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is an aggressive form of cancer unresponsive to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) that spreads quickly to other organs. Despite reduced androgen levels after ADT, mCRPC development and lethality continues to be conducted by the androgen receptor (AR) axis. The maintenance of AR signaling in mCRPC is a result of AR alterations, androgen intratumoral production, and the action of regulatory elements, such as noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). ncRNAs are key elements in cancer signaling, acting in tumor growth, metabolic reprogramming, and tumor progression. In prostate cancer (PCa), the ncRNAs have been reported to be associated with AR expression, PCa proliferation, and castration resistance. In this study, we aimed to reconstruct the lncRNA-centered regulatory network of mCRPC and identify the lncRNAs which act as master regulators (MRs). Methods We used publicly available RNA-sequencing to infer the regulatory network of lncRNAs in mCRPC. Five gene signatures were employed to conduct the master regulator analysis. Inferred MRs were then subjected to functional enrichment and symbolic regression modeling. The latter approach was applied to identify the lncRNAs with greater predictive capacity and potential as a biomarker in mCRPC. Results We identified 31 lncRNAs involved in cellular proliferation, tumor metabolism, and invasion-metastasis cascade. SNHG18 and HELLPAR were the highlights of our results. SNHG18 was downregulated in mCRPC and enriched to metastasis signatures. It accurately distinguished both mCRPC and primary CRPC from normal tissue and was associated with epithelial--mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell-matrix adhesion pathways. HELLPAR consistently distinguished mCRPC from primary CRPC and normal tissue using only its expression. Conclusion Our results contribute to understanding the regulatory behavior of lncRNAs in mCRPC and indicate SNHG18 and HELLPAR as master regulators and potential new diagnostic targets in this tumor.},

  abstract = {The analysis of microbiota composition in humans, animals, and built environments is important because of emerging roles and applications in a broad range of disease and ecological phenotypes. Next Generation Sequencing is the current method of choice to characterize microbial community composition. The taxonomic profile of a microbial community can be obtained either by shotgun analysis of random DNA fragments or through 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) amplicon sequencing. It has been previously shown that the 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing approach yields quantitatively and qualitatively different results compared to shotgun metagenomics when the two techniques are used to assess microbial community composition on the same samples. However, most of such comparisons were either based on the recovery of 16S rDNA sequences in the shotgun metagenomics data or limited to a single microbiome or synthetic samples. Direct comparison of shotgun metagenomics and 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing on the same samples was performed only once in the recent literature, suggesting that the two methods yield comparable results. Here, we set out to compare the outcome of these two alternative approaches to the microbiome characterization in human gut microbiomes from stool samples. To this end, we processed six different samples with both techniques. We report here that shotgun next generation sequencing metagenomics allows much deeper characterization of the microbiome complexity, allowing identification of a larger number of species for each sample, compared to 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Further comparative studies in independent samples are called for.},

Its complexity makes it difficult to establish a consensus on genetic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. A promising strategy is to investigate the regulatory mechanisms involved in sepsis progression, but there are few studies regarding gene regulation in sepsis. This work aimed to reconstruct the sepsis regulatory network and identify transcription factors (TFs) driving transcriptional states, which we refer to here as master regulators. We used public gene expression datasets to infer the co-expression network associated with sepsis in a retrospective study. We identified a set of 15 TFs as potential master regulators of pediatric sepsis, which were divided into two main clusters. The first cluster corresponded to TFs with decreased activity in pediatric sepsis, and GATA3 and RORA, as well as other TFs previously implicated in the context of inflammatory response. The second cluster corresponded to TFs with increased activity in pediatric sepsis and was composed of TRIM25, RFX2, and MEF2A, genes not previously described as acting in a coordinated way in pediatric sepsis. Altogether, these results show how a subset of master regulators TF can drive pathological transcriptional states, with implications for sepsis biology and treatment.},

Exploration of this vast sequence space has been limited to a comparative analysis against reference microbial genomes and protein families derived from those genomes. Here, to examine the scale of yet untapped functional diversity beyond what is currently possible through the lens of reference genomes, we develop a computational approach to generate reference-free protein families from the sequence space in metagenomes. We analyse 26,931 metagenomes and identify 1.17\,billion protein sequences longer than 35 amino acids with no similarity to any sequences from 102,491 reference genomes or the Pfam database3. Using massively parallel graph-based clustering, we group these proteins into 106,198 novel sequence clusters with more than 100 members, doubling the number of protein families obtained from the reference genomes clustered using the same approach. We annotate these families on the basis of their taxonomic, habitat, geographical and gene neighbourhood distributions and, where sufficient sequence diversity is available, predict protein three-dimensional models, revealing novel structures. Overall, our results uncover an enormously diverse functional space, highlighting the importance of further exploring the microbial functional dark matter.},

Although long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in mCRPC, past studies have relied on bulk sequencing methods with low depth and lack of single-cell resolution. Hence, we performed a lncRNA-focused analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data (n\,=\,14) from mCRPC biopsies followed by integration with bulk multi-omic datasets. This yielded 389 cell-enriched lncRNAs in prostate cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME). These lncRNAs demonstrated enrichment with regulatory elements and exhibited alterations during prostate cancer progression. Prostate-lncRNAs were correlated with AR mutational status and response to treatment with enzalutamide, while TME-lncRNAs were associated with RB1 deletions and poor prognosis. Finally, lncRNAs identified between prostate adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine tumors exhibited distinct expression and methylation profiles. Our findings demonstrate the ability of single-cell analysis to refine our understanding of lncRNAs in mCRPC and serve as a resource for future mechanistic studies.},

  abstract = {Modern metagenomic environmental DNA studies are almost completely reliant on next-generation sequencing, making evaluations of these methods critical. We compare two next-generation sequencing techniques -- amplicon and shotgun -- on water samples across four of Brazil's major river floodplain systems (Amazon, Araguaia, Paran{\'a}, and Pantanal). Less than 50\% of phyla identified via amplicon sequencing were recovered from shotgun sequencing, clearly challenging the dogma that mid-depth shotgun recovers more diversity than amplicon-based approaches. Amplicon sequencing also revealed {\textasciitilde}27\% more families. Overall the amplicon data were more robust across both biodiversity and community ecology analyses at different taxonomic scales. Our work doubles the sampling size in similar~environmental studies, and novelly integrates environmental data (e.g., pH, temperature, nutrients) from each site, revealing divergent correlations depending on which data are used. While myriad variants on NGS techniques and bioinformatic pipelines are available, our results point to core differences that have not been highlighted in any studies to date. Given the low number of taxa identified when coupling shotgun data with clade-based taxonomic algorithms, previous studies that quantified biodiversity using such bioinformatic tools should be viewed cautiously or re-analyzed. Nonetheless, shotgun has complementary advantages that should be weighed when designing projects.},

  abstract = {Molecular characterization of cell types using single-cell transcriptome sequencing is revolutionizing cell biology and enabling new insights into the physiology of human organs. We created a human reference atlas comprising nearly 500,000 cells from 24 different tissues and organs, many from the same donor. This atlas enabled molecular characterization of more than 400 cell types, their distribution across tissues, and tissue-specific variation in gene expression. Using multiple tissues from a single donor enabled identification of the clonal distribution of T cells between tissues, identification of the tissue-specific mutation rate in B cells, and analysis of the cell cycle state and proliferative potential of shared cell types across tissues. Cell type--specific RNA splicing was discovered and analyzed across tissues within an individual.},
