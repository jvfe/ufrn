Schematic outlining the various known bidirectional pathways of communication between the gut-microbiota and the brain, including hepatic and gallbladder metabolism, immune-modulatory responses, neuronal innervation, enteroendocrine, and microbial metabolite signaling. CCK, cholecystokinin; GLP-1, glu- cagon-like peptide-1; IL, interleukin; PYY, peptide YY; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; SCFA, short-chain fatty acid.

## Summary {.smaller}

- Investigate the relation between the gut microbiome's diversity and composition and depressive symptoms in **1.054** subjects of the 'Rotterdam Study' (RS) and validate the findings in participants of the 'HELIUS Study' in Amsterdam (**1.539**).

- Alpha diversity is negatively associated with depressive symptoms

- Beta diversity is positively associated (in RS)

- 12 genera and 1 family associated with depressive symptoms were identified.
  - Taxa that were previously associated with neurotransmisser production.

- With major depression as the exposure, Eggerthella, showed significant MR results (effect = 0.237, p value = 0.027).


## How did they evaluate the depressive symptoms? {.smaller}

- In RS they were evaluated with the CES-D scale.
  - A 20 item questionnaire that identifies depressive symptoms.
  - **All participants are of european heritage**

- In HELIUS they were evaluated with the PHQ-9 scale.
  - Scores DSM-IV symptoms in a scale of 0 to 3.
  - Total score goes from 0-21 with scores \>= 10 identifying depressive subjects.
  - Multiethnic cohort but filtered down to only contain individuals of European heritage.

## How did they associate taxa and depressive symptoms? {.smaller}

::: r-stack
- Through a linear regression! Using alfa-diversity and the presence-absence of taxa as the input variables and depression scores as the outcomes.
    -   Adjusted by covariates like age, sex, alcohol use, BMI, smoking, medication use, etc.

-   To associate beta-diversity with the scores, they used a PERMANOVA.

-   A random forest regression was also used, RS being the training dataset and HELIUS being the test dataset.

-   Results were combined in a meta-analysis, using sample-size weighted meta-analysis to combine results. Adjustment for multiple testing was performed using false discovery rate (FDR) using Benjamini-Hochberg correction.

## Causal inference {.smaller}

-   *Mendelian Randomization*
    - A two-sample MR was used,  using the results of the largest genome-wide association studies of both microbiome and major depression.
    -   For major depression we used genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instruments to estimate the effect of these SNPs on the presence/absence of taxa.
    -   For microbiome there were none to a very few SNPs that were genome-wide significantly associated with the identified microbiota, so they used SNPs with a p-value \<10<sup>-05</sup> as instruments.

-   With major depression as the exposure, *Eggerthella*, showed significant MR results under the IVW method (effect = 0.237, p value=0.027) .
  -   The Steiger test for directionality suggests that Eggerthella is more likely to be causally associated with MDD

## What do these taxa have to do with depression? {.smaller}

- *Coprococcus* depletion has been observed in animal models of depression.
-   *Sellimonas* presents itself in various cases of disbiosis, besides being linked to inflammatory diseases

-   The majority of taxa are associated with the synthesis of glutamate and butyrate.

    -   Serum levels of glutamate have been associated with mood disorders.
    -   Butyrate is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and has been implicated in the increase of cholinergic activity. Sodium butyrate has shown anti-depressive effects in animals models.

-   *Eggerthella* has been observed in 8 depression-related studies and is associated with the production of serotonin

    -   Gut serotonin doesn't cross the BBB, but alters its permeability, potentially favouring inflammation.
