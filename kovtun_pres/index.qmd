## Introduction {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
- "Inflammation is now considered one of the primary pathologies that lead to depression."

- "The main process when suppressing inflammation is the activation of the immune response, in particular, the production of cytokines. This affects the levels of neuro-compounds, which in turn leads to the development of MDD. "

- "GM also produces microbial compounds that mediate crosstalk with the immune system of the host and play an important role in the GBA"

- "In this work, we used whole metagenome sequencing analysis, which gave us an opportunity to profile functional representations and metabolic pathways in the bacterial community."

## Methods {.smaller}

- Fecal samples; Illumina HiSeqX Ten (PRJNA762199)

- Patients with depressive outbreaks of medium or high severity (ICD-10)

- Healthy volunteers (group HC) were chosen for the control group by the following criteria: no diagnosed psychiatric disease; CES-D < 18; GAD-7 < 5; etc.

## Taxonomic results

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
- There were no significant differences in alpha-diversity.

- This is consistent with numerous studies that have also reported no differences in alpha-diversity between MDD and control groups

## Taxonomic results

- “The beta diversity analysis, on the other hand, demonstrated a difference at the ‘Species’ level between the two groups (p-value = 0.001, PERMANOVA test”

## Taxonomic results {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
- “Decreased levels of Faecalibacterium and Roseburia may contribute to disease pathology, as depression is associated with a mild chronic inflammatory response.”

- "Genus Escherichia was also significantly increased in the PwD metagenomes. Overgrowth of Escherichia bacteria could lead to gut inflammation and increase permeability of the gut wall"

## Functional results {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
- “There was a connection between severity of disease and decreased abundances of the genes involved in the metabolic pathways of 17-beta-estradiol, asparagine, GLU, and conjugated linoleic”

- "The decreased abundance of the gene involved in the degradation of 17β-estradiol (E2) also corresponded with a decrease in the genus Faecalibacterium. E2 is the most potent naturally circulating estrogen, which affects cognition, anxiety, depression, and the GM"

## Conclusions {.smaller}

- "Our analyses revealed statistically significant decreases in the levels of genes encoding enzymes involved in the production of amino acids in the GM of patients with depression."

- "Our data demonstrated a decrease in beneficial bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, and Lachnospira, along with an increase in abundances of opportunistic pathogens, such as Ruthenibacterium and Escherichia"

- “Stimulating growth of diminished beneficial bacteria and reducing numbers of undesirable bacteria may be a strategy for the correction of GM in depressive patients."

- **“Using a broader reference may lead to the identification of additional metabolites correlated with manifestations of depressive disorder.”**
