  abstract = {In the last few years, investigation of the gut--brain axis and the connection between the gut microbiota and the human nervous system and mental health has become one of the most popular topics. Correlations between the taxonomic and functional changes in gut microbiota and major depressive disorder have been shown in several studies. Machine learning provides a promising approach to analyze large-scale metagenomic data and identify biomarkers associated with depression. In this work, machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, elastic net, and You Only Look Once (YOLO), were utilized to detect significant features in microbiome samples and classify individuals based on their disorder status. The analysis was conducted on metagenomic data obtained during the study of gut microbiota of healthy people and patients with major depressive disorder. The YOLO method showed the greatest effectiveness in the analysis of the metagenomic samples and confirmed the experimental results on the critical importance of a reduction in the amount of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii for the manifestation of depression. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in major depressive disorder and potentially lead the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {Depression is a global threat to mental health that affects around 264 million people worldwide. Despite the considerable evolution in our understanding of the pathophysiology of depression, no reliable biomarkers that have contributed to objective diagnoses and clinical therapy currently exist. The discovery of the microbiota-gut-brain axis induced scientists to study the role of gut microbiota (GM) in the pathogenesis of depression. Over the last decade, many of studies were conducted in this field. The productions of metabolites and compounds with neuroactive and immunomodulatory properties among mechanisms such as the mediating effects of the GM on the brain, have been identified. This comprehensive review was focused on low molecular weight compounds implicated in depression as potential products of the GM. The other possible mechanisms of GM involvement in depression were presented, as well as changes in the composition of the microbiota of patients with depression. In conclusion, the therapeutic potential of functional foods and psychobiotics in relieving depression were considered. The described biomarkers associated with GM could potentially enhance the diagnostic criteria for depressive disorders in clinical practice and represent a potential future diagnostic tool based on metagenomic technologies for assessing the development of depressive disorders.},

  abstract = {Low levels of gonadal circulating estrogen observed in post-menopausal women can adversely impact a diverse range of physiological factors, with clinical implications for brain cognition, gut health, the female reproductive tract and other aspects of women's health. One of the principal regulators of circulating estrogens is the gut microbiome. This review aims to shed light on the role of the gut microbiota in estrogen-modulated disease. The gut microbiota regulates estrogens through secretion of {$\beta$}-glucuronidase, an enzyme that deconjugates estrogens into their active forms. When this process is impaired through dysbiosis of gut microbiota, characterized by lower microbial diversity, the decrease in deconjugation results in a reduction of circulating estrogens. The alteration in circulating estrogens may contribute to the development of conditions discussed herein: obesity, metabolic syndrome, cancer, endometrial hyperplasia, endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, fertility, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cognitive function. The bi-directional relationship between the metabolic profile (including estrogen levels) and gut microbiota in estrogen-driven disease will also be discussed. Promising therapeutic interventions manipulating the gut microbiome and the metabolic profile of estrogen-driven disease, such as bariatric surgery and metformin, will be detailed. Modulation of the microbiome composition subsequently impacts the metabolic profile, and vice versa, and has been shown to alleviate many of the estrogen-modulated disease states. Last, we highlight promising research interventions in the field, such as dietary therapeutics, and discuss areas that provide exciting unexplored topics of study.},

  abstract = {Cumulative evidence shows a linkage between gut microbiota pattern and depression through the brain-gut microbiome axis. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the alterations of the gut microbiota patterns in people with depression compared to healthy controls. A comprehensive literature search of human studies, published between January 2000 and June 2019, was reviewed. The key words included gastrointestinal microbiome, gut microbiome, microbiota, depression, depressive symptoms, and depressive disorder. The systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Nine articles met the eligibility criteria. Disparities in {$\alpha$}-diversity and {$\beta$}-diversity of the microbiota existed in people with depression compared to healthy controls. At the phylum level, there were inconsistencies in the abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. However, high abundance in Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria phyla were observed in people with depression. On the family level, high abundance of Actinomycineae, Coriobacterineae, Bifidobacteriaceae, Clostridiales incertae sedis XI, Porphyromonadaceae, Clostridiaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Streptococcaceae, Eubacteriaceae, Thermoanaerobacteriaceae, Fusobacteriaceae, Nocardiaceae, Streptomycetaceae, and low abundance of Veillonellaceae, Prevotellaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Sutterellaceae, Oscillospiraceae, Marniabilaceae, and Chitinophagaceae were observed in people with depression. On the genus level, high abundance of Oscillibacter, Blautia, Holdemania, Clostridium XIX, Anaerostipes, Anaerofilum, Streptococcus, Gelria, Turicibacter, Parabacteroides, Eggerthella, Klebsiella, Paraprevotella, Veillonella, Clostridium IV, Erysipelotrichaceae incertae sedis, Eubacterium, Parvimonas, Desulfovibrio, Parasutterella, Actinomyces, Asaccharobacter, Atopobium, Olsenella and low abundance of Coprococcus, Lactobacillus, Escherichia/Shigella, Clostridium XlVa, Dialister, Howardella, Pyramidobacter, and Sutterella were found in people with depression. Alteration of gut microbiome patterns was evident in people with depression. Further evidence is warranted to allow for the translation of microbiome findings toward innovative clinical strategies that may improve treatment outcomes in people with depression.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms can be found in virtually any environment. In humans, the largest collection of microorganisms is found in the gut ecosystem. The adult gut microbiome consists of more genes than its human host and typically spans more than 60 genera from across the taxonomic tree. In addition, the gut contains the largest number of neurons in the body, after the brain. In recent years, it has become clear that the gut microbiome is in communication with the brain, through the gut--brain axis. A growing body of literature shows that the gut microbiome plays a shaping role in a variety of psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). In this review, the interplay between the microbiome and MDD is discussed in three facets. First, we discuss factors that affect the onset/development of MDD that also greatly impinge on the composition of the gut microbiota---especially diet and stressful life events. We then examine the interplay between the microbiota and MDD. We examine evidence suggesting that the microbiota is altered in MDD, and we discuss why the microbiota should be considered during MDD treatment. Finally, we look toward the future and examine how the microbiota might become a therapeutic target for MDD. This review is intended to introduce those familiar with the neurological and psychiatric aspects of MDD to the microbiome and its potential role in the disorder. Although research is in its very early days, with much yet to be the understood, the microbiome is offering new avenues for developing potentially novel strategies for managing MDD.},

To leverage these, we present bioBakery 3, a set of integrated, improved methods for taxonomic, strain-level, functional, and phylogenetic profiling of metagenomes newly developed to build on the largest set of reference sequences now available. Compared to current alternatives, MetaPhlAn 3 increases the accuracy of taxonomic profiling, and HUMAnN 3 improves that of functional potential and activity. These methods detected novel disease-microbiome links in applications to CRC (1262 metagenomes) and IBD (1635 metagenomes and 817 metatranscriptomes). Strain-level profiling of an additional 4077 metagenomes with StrainPhlAn 3 and PanPhlAn 3 unraveled the phylogenetic and functional structure of the common gut microbe Ruminococcus bromii, previously described by only 15 isolate genomes. With open-source implementations and cloud-deployable reproducible workflows, the bioBakery 3 platform can help researchers deepen the resolution, scale, and accuracy of multi-omic profiling for microbial community studies.},

Thus, carnosine turns out to be a multipotent protector against oxidative damage. However, the role of carnosine in the brain remains unclear. The key aspects concerning carnosine in the brain reviewed are as follows: its concentration and bioavailability, mechanisms of action in neuronal and glial cells, beneficial effects in human studies. Recent literature data and the results of our own research are summarized here. This review covers studies of carnosine effects on both in vitro and in vivo models of cerebral damage, such as neurodegenerative disorders and ischemic injuries and the data on its physiological actions on neuronal signaling and cerebral functions. Besides its antioxidant and homeostatic properties, new potential roles of carnosine in the brain are discussed.},

Using a combination of statistical and machine learning models, we showed that species including Alistipes obesi, Blautia wexlerae, and Ruminococcus gnavus were enriched or depleted in children with higher cognitive function scores. Microbial metabolism of short-chain fatty acids was also associated with cognitive function. In addition, machine models were able to predict the volume of brain regions from microbial profiles, and taxa that were important in predicting cognitive function were also important for predicting individual brain regions and specific subscales of cognitive function.

Thus, it is believed that other systems or pathways which regulate brain networks involved in mood regulation and cognition are associated with MDD pathogenesis. Studies in humans and animal models have been shown that in MDD there are increased levels of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokines in both periphery and central nervous system (CNS). In addition, microglial activation appears to be a key event that triggers changes in signaling cascades and gene expression that would be determinant for the onset of depressive symptoms. Recent researches also point out that changes in the gut microbiota would lead to a systemic inflammation that in different ways would reach the CNS modulating inflammatory pathways and especially the microglia, which could influence responses to treatments. Moreover, pre- and probiotics have shown antidepressant responses and anti-inflammatory effects. This review will focus on studies that show the relationship of inflammation with the gut microbiota--brain axis and its relation with MDD.},

Results indicated that the inducible nitric oxide synthase expression was higher in MDD patients compared with HC and the oxidative stress levels were greater in the a-MDD group. Furthermore, the lipopolysaccharide (an indirect marker of bacterial translocation) was higher in a-MDD patients compared with the other groups. Fecal samples did not cluster according to the presence or the absence of MDD. There were bacterial genera whose relative abundance was altered in MDD: Bilophila (2-fold) and Alistipes (1.5-fold) were higher, while Anaerostipes (1.5-fold) and Dialister (15-fold) were lower in MDD patients compared with HC. Patients with a-MDD presented higher relative abundance of Alistipes and Anaerostipes (1.5-fold) and a complete depletion of Dialister compared with HC. Patients with r-MDD presented higher abundance of Bilophila (2.5-fold) compared with HC. Thus, the abundance of bacterial genera and some immune pathways, both with potential implications in the pathophysiology of depression, appear to be altered in MDD, with the most noticeable changes occurring in patients with the worse clinical condition, the a-MDD group.},

  abstract = {Background:~           Depression is a frequent comorbidity in HIV infection that has been associated with worse treatment outcomes and increased mortality. Recent studies suggest that increased innate immune activation and tryptophan catabolism are associated with higher risk of depression in HIV infection and other chronic inflammatory diseases, but the mechanisms leading to depression remain poorly understood.           Methods:~           The severity of depressive symptoms was assessed by Beck Depression Inventory or Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Untargeted metabolomic profiling of plasma from 104 subjects (68 HIV-positive and 36 HIV-negative) across 3 independent cohorts was performed using liquid or gas chromatography followed by mass spectrometry. Cytokine profiling was by Bioplex array. Bioinformatic analysis was performed in Metaboanalyst and R.           Results:~           Decreased monoamine metabolites (phenylacetate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate) and acylcarnitines (propionylcarnitine, isobutyrylcarnitine, isovalerylcarnitine, 2-methylbutyrylcarnitine) in plasma distinguished depressed subjects from controls in HIV-positive and HIV-negative cohorts, and these alterations correlated with the severity of depressive symptoms. In HIV-positive subjects, acylcarnitines and other markers of mitochondrial function correlated inversely with tryptophan catabolism, a marker of interferon responses, suggesting interrelationships between inflammatory pathways, tryptophan catabolism, and metabolic alterations associated with depression. Altered metabolites mapped to pathways involved in monoamine metabolism, mitochondrial function, and inflammation, suggesting a model in which complex relationships between monoamine metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics contribute to biological mechanisms involved in depression that may be augmented by inflammation during HIV infection.           Conclusions:~           Integrated approaches targeting inflammation, monoamine metabolism, and mitochondrial pathways may be important for prevention and treatment of depression in people with and without HIV.},

  abstract = {The latest advancement in neurobiological research provided an increasing evidence that inflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways play a relevant role in depression. Preclinical and clinical studies on depression highlighted an increased production of inflammatory markers, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} and interferon- {$\alpha$}and {$\gamma$}. On the other hand, acute and chronic administration of cytokines or cytokine inducers were found to trigger depressive symptoms. According to the cytokine hypothesis, depression would be due to a stress-related increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that, in turn, would lead to increased oxidative and nitrosative brain damage and to indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) induction, with production of tryptophan (TRP) catabolites along the IDO pathway (TRYCATs) and consequent reduced availability of TRP and serotonin (5-HT). Cytokines would also play a role in the onset of the glucocorticoid resistance, underlying the overdrive of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Therefore, the activation of the inflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways would lead to the brain damage observed in depression through both reduced neurogenesis and increased neurodegeneration. Besides the 5-HT system, other targets, possibly within the I\&ND pathways, should be considered for the future treatment of depression: cytokines and their receptors, intracellular inflammatory mediators, IDO, TRYCATs, glucocorticoid receptors, neurotrophic factors may all represent possible therapeutic targets for novel antidepressants. In addition, it should be also clarified the role of the existing antiinflammatory drugs in the treatment of depression, and those compounds with the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties should be examined either as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. In conclusion, the molecular inflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways might provide new targets for antidepressant development and might be crucial to establish a rational treatment of depression aimed, hopefully, to its causal factors.},

  abstract = {The past few years have seen significant advances in the study of complex microbial communities associated with the evolution of sequencing technologies and increasing adoption of whole genome shotgun sequencing methods over the once more traditional Amplicon-based methods. Although these advances have broadened the horizon of meta-omic analyses in planetary health, human health, and ecology from simple sample composition studies to comprehensive taxonomic and metabolic profiles, there are still significant challenges in processing these data. First, there is a widespread lack of standardization in data processing, including software choices and the ease of installing and running attendant software. This can lead to several inconsistencies, making comparing results across studies and reproducing original results difficult. We argue that these drawbacks are especially evident in metatranscriptomic analysis, with most analyses relying on ad hoc scripts instead of pipelines implemented in workflow managers. Additional challenges rely on integrating meta-omic data, since methods have to consider the biases in the library preparation and sequencing methods and the technical noise that can arise from it. Here, we critically discuss the current limitations in metagenomics and metatranscriptomics methods with a view to catalyze future innovations in the field of Planetary Health, ecology, and allied fields of life sciences. We highlight possible solutions for these constraints to bring about more standardization, with ease of installation, high performance, and reproducibility as guiding principles.},

  abstract = {Background Observational studies showed an association between gut microbiota and depression, but the causality relationship between them is unclear. We aimed to determine whether there is a bidirectional causal relationship between the composition of gut microbiota and major depressive disorders (MDD) and explore the role of gut microbiota in decreasing the risk of MDD. Methods Our two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study acquired top SNPs associated with the composition of gut microbiota (n\,=\,18,340) and with MDDs (n\,=\,480,359) from publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The SNPs estimates were pooled using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis, with sensitivity analyses---weighted median, MR Egger, and MR Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier (PRESSO). Results The Actinobacteria class had protective causal effects on MDD (OR 0.88, 95\%CI 0.87 to 0.9). The Bifidobacterium (OR 0.89, 95\%CI 0.88 to 0.91) were further found to have similar effects as the Actinobacteria class. The genus Ruminococcus1 had a protective effect on MDD (OR 0.88, 95\%CI 0.76 to 0.99) while the Streptococcaceae family and its genus had an anti-protective effect on MDD (OR 1.07, 95\%CI 1.01 to 1.13), but these findings were not supported by the MR-Egger analysis. Bidirectional MR showed no effect of MDD on gut microbiota composition. Limitations The use of summary-level data, the risk of sample overlap and low statistical power are the major limiting factors. Conclusions Our MR analysis showed a protective effect of Actinobacteria, Bifidobacterium, and Ruminococcus and a potentially anti-protective effect of Streptococcaceae on MDD pathogenesis. Further studies are needed to transform the findings into practice.},

  abstract = {In the field of depression, inflammation-associated depression stands up as an exception since its causal factors are obvious and it is easy to mimic in an animal model. In addition, quasi-experimental studies can be carried out in patients who are treated chronically with recombinant cytokines for a medical condition since these patients can be studied longitudinally before, during and after stimulation of the immune system. These clinical studies have revealed that depression is a late phenomenon that develops over a background of early appearing sickness. Incorporation of this feature in animal models of inflammation-associated depression has allowed the demonstration that alterations of brain serotoninergic neurotransmission do not play a major role in the pathogenesis. This is in contrast to the activation of the tryptotphan degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase that generates potentially neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites such as 3-hydroxy kynurenine and quinolinic acid. Although the relative importance of peripherally versus centrally produced kynurenine and the cellular source of production of this compound remain to be determined, these findings provide new targets for the treatment of inflammation-associated depression that could be extended to other psychiatric conditions mediated by activation of neuroimmune mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The prenatal and early postnatal stages represent a critical time window for human brain development. Interestingly, this window partly overlaps with the maturation of the intestinal flora (microbiota) that play a critical role in the bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous systems (microbiota-gut-brain axis). The microbial composition has important influences on general health and the development of several organ systems, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the immune system, and also the brain. Clinical studies have shown that microbiota alterations are associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. In this review, we dissect the link between these neuropsychiatric disorders and the intestinal microbiota by focusing on their effect on synaptic pruning, a vital process in the maturation and establishing efficient functioning of the brain. We discuss in detail how synaptic pruning is dysregulated differently in the aforementioned neuropsychiatric disorders and how it can be influenced by dysbiosis and/or changes in the intestinal microbiota composition. We also review that the improvement in the intestinal microbiota composition by a change in diet, probiotics, prebiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation may play a role in improving neuropsychiatric functioning, which can be at least partly explained via the optimization of synaptic pruning and neuronal connections. Altogether, the demonstration of the microbiota's influence on brain function via microglial-induced synaptic pruning addresses the possibility that the manipulation of microbiota-immune crosstalk represents a promising strategy for treating neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prominent cause of disability worldwide. Current antidepressant drugs produce full remission in only about one-third of MDD patients and there are no biomarkers to guide physicians in selecting the best treatment for individuals. There is an urgency to learn more about the etiology of MDD and to identify new targets that will lead to improved therapy and hopefully aid in predicting and preventing MDD. There has been extensive interest in the roles of the immune system and the gut microbiome in MDD and in how these systems interact. Gut microbes can contribute to the nature of immune responses, and a chronic inflammatory state may lead to increased responsiveness to stress and to development of MDD. The gut microbiome-immune system-brain axis is bidirectional, is sensitive to stress and is important in development of stress-related disorders such as MDD. Communication between the gut and brain involves the enteric nervous system (ENS), the autonomic nervous system (ANS), neuroendocrine signaling systems and the immune system, and all of these can interact with the gut microbiota. Preclinical studies and preliminary clinical investigations have reported improved mood with administration of probiotics and prebiotics, but large, carefully controlled clinical trials are now necessary to evaluate their effectiveness in treating MDD. The roles that several gut microbe-derived molecules such as neurotransmitters, short chain fatty acids and tryptophan play in MDD are reviewed briefly. Challenges and potential future directions associated with studying this important axis as it relates to MDD are discussed.},

Genes associated with similar disorders show both higher likelihood of physical interactions between their products and higher expression profiling similarity for their transcripts, supporting the existence of distinct disease-specific functional modules. We find that essential human genes are likely to encode hub proteins and are expressed widely in most tissues. This suggests that disease genes also would play a central role in the human interactome. In contrast, we find that the vast majority of disease genes are nonessential and show no tendency to encode hub proteins, and their expression pattern indicates that they are localized in the functional periphery of the network. A selection-based model explains the observed difference between essential and disease genes and also suggests that diseases caused by somatic mutations should not be peripheral, a prediction we confirm for cancer genes.},

Here we report a 16S rRNA-based analysis of the gut microbiome in 1,126 twin pairs, a subset of which was previously reported.

Repeat sampling of subjects showed heritable taxa to be temporally stable. A candidate gene approach uncovered associations between heritable taxa and genes related to diet, metabolism, and olfaction. We replicate an association between Bifidobacterium and the lactase (LCT) gene locus and identify an association between the host gene ALDH1L1 and the bacteria SHA-98, suggesting a link between formate production and blood pressure. Additional genes detected are involved in barrier defense and self/non-self recognition. Our results indicate that diet-sensing, metabolism, and immune defense are~important drivers of human-microbiome co-evolution.},

  abstract = {An increasingly common output arising from the analysis of shotgun metagenomic datasets is the generation of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), with tens of thousands of MAGs now described in the literature. However, the discovery and comparison of these MAG collections is hampered by the lack of uniformity in their generation, annotation and storage. To address this, we have developed MGnify Genomes, a growing collection of biome-specific non-redundant microbial genome catalogues generated using MAGs and publicly available isolate genomes. Genomes within a biome-specific catalogue are organised into species clusters. For species that contain multiple conspecific genomes, the highest quality genome is selected as the representative, always prioritising an isolate genome over a MAG. The species representative sequences and annotations can be visualised on the MGnify website and the full catalogue and associated analysis outputs can be downloaded from MGnify servers. A suite of online search tools is provided allowing users to compare their own sequences, ranging from a gene to sets of genomes, against the catalogues. Seven biomes are available currently, comprising over 300,000 genomes that represent 11,048 non-redundant species, and include 36 taxonomic classes not currently represented by cultured genomes. MGnify Genomes is available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/browse/genomes/.},

The end products of NO production include both NO and L-citrulline. NO is rapidly reduced to the anions nitrite and nitrate, classically referred to as NO metabolites. Their measurement has been used as a surrogate measurement for endothelial NO production. We and others have shown decreased levels of NO metabolites in the serum of MD patients.

Depending on the localized regions, microbiota can be classified into gut, oral, respiratory, and skin microbiota. The microbial communities are in symbiosis with the host, contributing to homeostasis and regulating immune function. However, microbiota dysbiosis can lead to dysregulation of bodily functions and diseases including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, respiratory diseases, etc. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of how microbiota links to host health or pathogenesis. We first summarize the research of microbiota in healthy conditions, including the gut-brain axis, colonization resistance and immune modulation. Then, we highlight the pathogenesis of microbiota dysbiosis in disease development and progression, primarily associated with dysregulation of community composition, modulation of host immune response, and induction of chronic inflammation. Finally, we introduce the clinical approaches that utilize microbiota for disease treatment, such as microbiota modulation and fecal microbial transplantation.},

Previous genetic studies have identified common risk variants which have progressively increased in number with increasing sample sizes of the respective studies. Here, we conduct a genome-wide association study in 322,580 UK Biobank participants for three depression-related phenotypes: broad depression, probable major depressive disorder (MDD), and International Classification of Diseases (ICD, version 9 or 10)-coded MDD. We identify 17 independent loci that are significantly associated (P\,{$<$}\,5\,{\texttimes}\,10-8) across the three phenotypes. The direction of effect of these loci is consistently replicated in an independent sample, with 14 loci likely representing novel findings. Gene sets are enriched in excitatory neurotransmission, mechanosensory behaviour, post synapse, neuron spine and dendrite functions. Our findings suggest that broad depression is the most tractable UK Biobank phenotype for discovering genes and gene sets that further our understanding of the biological pathways underlying depression.},

Here, we analyzed fecal samples from 46 patients with depression (29 active-MDD and 17 responded-MDD) and 30 healthy controls (HCs). High-throughput pyrosequencing showed that, according to the Shannon index, increased fecal bacterial {$\alpha$}-diversity was found in the active-MDD (A-MDD) vs. the HC group but not in the responded-MDD (R-MDD) vs. the HC group. Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria strongly increased in level, whereas that of Firmicutes was significantly reduced in the A-MDD and R-MDD groups compared with the HC group. Despite profound interindividual variability, levels of several predominant genera were significantly different between the MDD and HC groups. Most notably, the MDD groups had increased levels of Enterobacteriaceae and Alistipes but reduced levels of Faecalibacterium. A negative correlation was observed between Faecalibacterium and the severity of depressive symptoms. These findings enable a better understanding of changes in the fecal microbiota composition in such patients, showing either a predominance of some potentially harmful bacterial groups or a reduction in beneficial bacterial genera. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the temporal and causal relationships between gut microbiota and depression and to evaluate the suitability of the microbiome as a biomarker.},

Histidine-containing dipeptides (HCDs) have been suggested to mitigate some aspects of mental ill-health, but a quantitative synthesis of the evidence is lacking. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted.To summarize the evidence on the effects of HCDs on mental health outcomes.A systematic literature search was performed using electronic databases (Medline via Ovid, Embase via Ovid, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Cochrane) from inception to October, 2022.Two authors independently extracted data using a structured extraction format.Data analysis was performed using STATA version 17. Random-effects models were used, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 test. Quality appraisal was performed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias 2.0 tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.5507 studies were identified, with 20 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Eighteen studies comprising 776 participants were included in the meta-analysis. HCD supplementation (anserine/carnosine, l-carnosine, {$\beta$}-alanine) caused a significant reduction in depression scores measured with the Becks Depression Inventory (-0.79; 95\% CI: -1.24, -0.35; moderate certainty on GRADE) when compared with placebo. An increase in quality-of-life scores measured with the 36-item Short-Form survey (SF-36) (0.65; 95\% CI: 0.00, 1.30) and low certainty on GRADE in HCDs (anserine/carnosine, l-carnosine, {$\beta$}-alanine) when compared with placebo were found. However, the rest of the outcomes did not show a significant change between HCD supplementation and placebo. Although the number of studies included in the meta-analysis was modest, a significant mean reduction was observed in depression score as well as an increase in quality-of-life score for the HCD group when compared with placebo. Most of the studies included had small sample sizes with short follow-up periods and moderate to high risk of bias, highlighting the need for further, well-designed studies to improve the evidence base.PROSPERO registration no.

  abstract = {It has become increasingly clear that the gut microbiota influences not only gastrointestinal physiology but also central nervous system (CNS) function by modulating signalling pathways of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning the influence exerted by the gut microbiota on brain function and behaviour has become a key research priority. Microbial regulation of tryptophan metabolism has become a focal point in this regard, with dual emphasis on the regulation of serotonin synthesis and the control of kynurenine pathway metabolism. Here, we focus in detail on the latter pathway and begin by outlining the structural and functional dynamics of the gut microbiota and the signalling pathways of the brain-gut axis. We summarise preclinical and clinical investigations demonstrating that the gut microbiota influences CNS physiology, anxiety, depression, social behaviour, cognition and visceral pain. Pertinent studies are drawn from neurogastroenterology demonstrating the importance of tryptophan and its metabolites in CNS and gastrointestinal function. We outline how kynurenine pathway metabolism may be regulated by microbial control of neuroendocrine function and components of the immune system. Finally, preclinical evidence demonstrating direct and indirect mechanisms by which the gut microbiota can regulate tryptophan availability for kynurenine pathway metabolism, with downstream effects on CNS function, is reviewed. Targeting the gut microbiota represents a tractable target to modulate kynurenine pathway metabolism. Efforts to develop this approach will markedly increase our understanding of how the gut microbiota shapes brain and behaviour and provide new insights towards successful translation of microbiota-gut-brain axis research from bench to bedside.

OMARU rigorously controls the statistical significance of the analysis results, including correction of hidden confounding factors and application of multiple testing comparisons. Furthermore, OMARU can evaluate pathway-level links between the metagenome and the germline genome-wide association study (i.e. MWAS-GWAS pathway interaction), as well as links between taxa and genes in the metagenome. OMARU is publicly available (https://github.com/toshi-kishikawa/OMARU), with a flexible workflow that can be customized by users. We applied OMARU to publicly available type 2 diabetes (T2D) and schizophrenia (SCZ) metagenomic data (n~=~171 and 344, respectively), identifying disease biomarkers through comprehensive, multilateral, and unbiased case--control comparisons of metagenome (e.g. increased Streptococcus vestibularis in SCZ and disrupted diversity in T2D). OMARU improves accessibility and reproducibility in the microbiome research community. Robust and multifaceted results of OMARU reflect the dynamics of the microbiome authentically relevant to disease pathophysiology.},

  abstract = {Accumulating evidence indicates that gut microbiota may regulate sex-hormone levels in the host, with effects on reproductive health. Very little is known about the development of intestinal microbiota during puberty in humans. To assess the connection between pubertal timing and fecal microbiota, and to assess how fecal microbiota develop during puberty in comparison with adult microbiota, we utilized a Finnish allergy-prevention-trial cohort (Flora). Data collected at 13-year follow-up were compared with adult data from a different Finnish cohort. Among the 13-year-old participants we collected questionnaire information, growth data from school-health-system records and fecal samples from 148 participants. Reference adult fecal samples were received from the Health and Early Life Microbiota (HELMi) cohort (n\,=\,840). Fecal microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing; the data were correlated with pubertal timing and compared with data on adult microbiota. Probiotic intervention in the allergy-prevention-trial cohort was considered as a confounding factor only. The main outcome was composition of the microbiota in relation to pubertal timing (time to/from peak growth velocity) in both sexes separately, and similarity to adult microbiota. In girls, fecal microbiota became more adult-like with pubertal progression (p\,=\,0.009). No such development was observed in boys (p\,=\,0.9). Both sexes showed a trend towards increasing relative abundance of estrogen-metabolizing Clostridia and decreasing Bacteroidia with pubertal development, but this was statistically significant in girls only (p\,=\,0.03). In girls, pubertal timing was associated positively with exposure to cephalosporins prior to the age of 10. Our data support the hypothesis that gut microbiota, particularly members of Ruminococcaceae, may affect pubertal timing, possibly via regulating host sex-hormone levels.},

Factors causing the pathogenesis of MDD include gut microbiota (GM), which interacts with the host through the gut--brain axis. In previous studies of GM in MDD patients, 16S rRNA sequencing was used, which provided information about composition but not about function. In our study, we analyzed whole metagenome sequencing data to assess changes in both the composition and functional profile of GM. We looked at the GM of 36 MDD patients, compared with that of 38 healthy volunteers. Comparative taxonomic analysis showed decreased abundances of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia hominis, and Roseburia intestinalis, and elevated abundances of Escherichia coli and Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans in the GM of MDD patients. We observed decreased levels of bacterial genes encoding key enzymes involved in the production of arginine, asparagine, glutamate, glutamine, melatonin, acetic, butyric and conjugated linoleic acids, and spermidine in MDD patients. These genes produced signature pairs with Faecalibacterium prausntizii and correlated with decreased levels of this species in the GM of MDD patients. These results show the potential impact of the identified biomarker bacteria and their metabolites on the pathogenesis of MDD, and should be confirmed in future metabolomic studies.},

  abstract = {To study the effect of host genetics on gut microbiome composition, the MiBioGen consortium curated and analyzed genome-wide genotypes and 16S fecal microbiome data from 18,340 individuals (24 cohorts). Microbial composition showed high variability across cohorts: only 9 of 410 genera were detected in more than 95\% of samples. A genome-wide association study of host genetic variation regarding microbial taxa identified 31 loci affecting the microbiome at a genome-wide significant (P\,{$<$}\,5\,{\texttimes}\,10-8) threshold. One locus, the lactase (LCT) gene locus, reached study-wide significance (genome-wide association study signal: P\,=\,1.28\,{\texttimes}\,10-20), and it showed an age-dependent association with Bifidobacterium abundance. Other associations were suggestive (1.95\,{\texttimes}\,10-10\,{$<$}\,P\,{$<$}\,5\,{\texttimes}\,10-8) but enriched for taxa showing high heritability and for genes expressed in the intestine and brain. A phenome-wide association study and Mendelian randomization identified enrichment of microbiome trait loci in the metabolic, nutrition and environment domains and suggested the microbiome might have causal effects in ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis.},

  abstract = {BackgroundThe microbiota--gut--brain axis, especially the microbial tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis and metabolism pathway (MiTBamp), may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, studies on the MiTBamp in MDD are lacking. The aim of the present study was to analyze the gut microbiota composition and the MiTBamp in MDD patients.MethodsWe performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool samples from 26 MDD patients and 29 healthy controls (HCs). In addition to the microbiota community and the MiTBamp analyses, we also built a classification based on the Random Forests (RF) and Boruta algorithm to identify the gut microbiota as biomarkers for MDD.ResultsThe Bacteroidetes abundance was strongly reduced whereas that of Actinobacteria was significantly increased in the MDD patients compared with the abundance in the HCs. Most noteworthy, the MDD patients had increased levels of Bifidobacterium, which is commonly used as a probiotic. Four Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologies (KOs) (K01817, K11358, K01626, K01667) abundances in the MiTBamp were significantly lower in the MDD group. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between the K01626 abundance and the HAMD scores in the MDD group. Finally, RF classification at the genus level can achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.890.ConclusionsThe present findings enabled a better understanding of the changes in gut microbiota and the related Trp pathway in MDD. Alterations of the gut microbiota may have the potential as biomarkers for distinguishing MDD patients form HCs.},

  abstract = {Background The microbiome-gut-brain axis, especially the microbial tryptophan biosynthesis and metabolism pathway (MiTBamp), is closely connected to bipolar disorder with current major depressive episode (BPD). Methods We performed shotgun metagenomics sequencing (SMS) of faecal samples from 25 BPD patients and 28 healthy controls (HCs). Except for the microbiota taxa and MiTBamp analyses, we also built a classification model using the Random Forests (RF) and Boruta algorithm to find the microbial biomarkers for BPD. Results Compared to HCs, the phylum Bacteroidetes abundance was significantly reduced, whereas that of the Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were significantly increased in BPD patients. We also identified 38 species increased and 6 species decreased significantly in the BPD group. In the MiTBamp, we identified that two Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologies (KOs) (K00658 and K00837) were significantly lower in the BPD, and five KOs (K01696, K00382, K00626, K01667, and K03781) were significantly higher in the BPD group. We also identified significant genera and species which were closely related to these KOs. Finally, RF classification based on gut microbiota at the genus level can achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.997. Limitations The features of cross-sectional design, limited sample size, the heterogeneity of bipolar disorders, and a lack of serum/plasma tryptophan concentration measurements. Conclusions The present findings enable a better understanding of changes in gastrointestinal microbiome and MiTBamp in BPD.

Having madethe observation that females with lactose malabsorption not only showed signs of irritable bowelsyndrome but also signs of premenstrual syndrome andmental depression, it was of interest to establishwhether a statistical correlation existed betweenlactose malabsorption and mental depression. Thirtyfemale volunteers were analyzed by measuring breathH2 concentrations after an oral dose of 50 glactose and were classified as normals or lactosemalabsorbers according to their breath H2concentrations. All patients filled out a Beck'sdepression inventory questionnaire. Of the 30 femalevolunteers, six were lactose intolerant (20\%) and 24were normal lactose absorbers (80\%). Subjects with lactosemalabsorption showed a significantly higher score in theBeck's depression inventory than normal lactoseabsorbers did. The data thus suggest that lactosemalabsorption may play a role in the development of mentaldepression. In lactose malabsorption high intestinallactose concentrations may interfere with L-tryptophanmetabolism and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin)availability. Lactose malabsorption should be considered inpatients with signs of mental depression.},

  abstract = {Gut microbes are associated with the development of depression based on extensive evidence. However, previous studies have led to conflicting reports on this association, posing challenges to the application of gut bacteria in the diagnostics and treatment of depression. To minimise heterogenicity in data analysis, the present meta-analysis adopted a standardised bioinformatics and statistical pipeline to analyse 16S rRNA sequences of 1827 samples from eight different cohorts. Although changes in the overall bacterial community were identified by our meta-analysis, depressive-correlated changes in alpha-diversity were absent. Enrichment of Bacteroidetes, Parabacteroides, Barnesiella, Bacteroides, and Bacteroides vulgatus, along with depletion in Firmicutes, Dialister, Oscillospiraceae UCG 003 and UCG 002, and Bacteroides plebeius, were observed in depressive-associated bacteria. By contrast, elevated L-glutamine degradation, and reduced L-glutamate and L-isoleucine biosynthesis were identified in depressive-associated microbiomes. After systemically reviewing the data of these collected cohorts, we have established a bacterial classifier to identify depressive symptoms with AUC 0.834 and 0.685 in the training and external validation dataset, respectively. Moreover, a low-risk bacterial cluster for depressive symptoms was identified, which was represented by a lower abundance of Escherichia-Shigella, and a higher abundance of Faecalibacterium, Oscillospiraceae UCG 002, Ruminococcus, and Christensenellaceae R.7 group.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Depression in childhood negatively affects the growth and development, school performance, and peer or family relationships of affected children, and may even lead to suicide. Despite this, its etiology and pathophysiology remain largely unknown. Increasing evidence supports that gut microbiota plays a vital role in the development of childhood depression. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms, as most clinical studies investigating the link between gut microbiota and depression have been undertaken in adult cohorts. In present study, a total of 140 school-aged children (6--12 years) were enrolled, including 92 with depression (male/female: 42/50) and 48 healthy controls (male/female: 22/26) from Lishui, Zhejiang, China. Illumina sequencing of the V3--V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate gut microbiota profiles while Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine 27-plex Panel was employed to explore host immune response. We found that, compared with healthy controls, children with depression had greater bacterial richness and altered {$\beta$}-diversity. Pro-inflammatory genera such as {$<$}italic{$>$}Streptococcus{$<$}/italic{$>$} were enriched in the depression group, whereas anti-inflammatory genera such as {$<$}italic{$>$}Faecalibacterium{$<$}/italic{$>$} were reduced, as determined by linear discriminant analysis effect size. These changes corresponded to altered bacterial functions, especially the production of immunomodulatory metabolites. We also identified the presence of a complex inflammatory condition in children with depression, characterized by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17 and decreased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-{$\gamma$}. Correlation analysis demonstrated that the differential cytokine abundance was closely linked to changes in gut microbiota of children with depression. In summary, key functional genera, such as {$<$}italic{$>$}Streptococcus{$<$}/italic{$>$} and {$<$}italic{$>$}Faecalibacterium{$<$}/italic{$>$}, alone or in combination, could serve as novel and powerful non-invasive biomarkers to distinguish between children with depression from healthy ones. This study was the first to demonstrate that, in Chinese children with depression, gut microbiota homeostasis is disrupted, concomitant with the activation of a complex pro-inflammatory response. These findings suggest that gut microbiota might play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression in school-aged children, while key functional bacteria in gut may serve as novel targets for non-invasive diagnosis and patient-tailored early precise intervention in children with depression.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Unfortunately, antidepressant drugs benefit only a small minority of patients. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new interventions. Accumulating evidence supports a causal relationship between gut microbiota dysbiosis and depression. To advance microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics of depression, a comprehensive overview of microbial alterations in depression is presented to identify effector microbial biomarkers. This procedure generated 215 bacterial taxa from humans and 312 from animal models. Compared to controls, depression shows significant differences in {$\beta$}-diversity, but no changes in microbial richness and diversity. Additionally, species-specific microbial changes are identified like increased Eggerthella in humans and decreased Acetatifactor in rodent models. Moreover, a disrupted microbiome balance and functional changes, characterized by an enrichment of pro-inflammatory bacteria (e.g., Desulfovibrio and Escherichia/Shigella) and depletion of anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium) are consistently shared across species. Confounding effects of geographical region, depression type, and intestinal segments are also investigated. Ultimately, a total of 178 species and subspecies probiotics are identified to alleviate the depressive phenotypes. Current findings provide a foundation for developing microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics and advancing microbiota-oriented precision medicine for depression.},

  abstract = {One very promising hypothesis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) pathogenesis is the gut-brain axis (GBA) dysfunction, which can lead to subclinical inflammation, hypothalamic--pituitary (HPA) axis dysregulation, and altered neural, metabolic and endocrine pathways. One of the most important parts of GBA is gut microbiota, which was shown to regulate different functions in the central nervous system (CNS). The purpose of this scoping review was to present the current state of research on the relationship between MDD and gut microbiota and extract causal relationships. Further, we presented the relationship between the use of probiotics and antidepressants, and the microbiota changes. We evaluated the data from 27 studies aimed to investigate microbial fingerprints associated with depression phenotype. We abstracted data from 16 and 11 observational and clinical studies, respectively; the latter was divided into trials evaluating the effects of psychiatric treatment (n\,=\,3) and probiotic intervention (n\,=\,9) on the microbiome composition and function. In total, the data of 1187 individuals from observational studies were assessed. In clinical studies, there were 490 individuals analysed. In probiotic studies, 220 and 218 patients with MDD received the intervention and non-active study comparator, respectively. It was concluded that in MDD, the microbiota is altered. Although the mechanism of this relationship is unknown, we hypothesise that the taxonomic changes observed in patients with MDD are associated with bacterial proinflammatory activity, reduced Schort Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) production, impaired intestinal barrier integrity and neurotransmitter production, impaired carbohydrates, tryptophane and glutamate metabolic pathways. However, only in few publications this effect was confirmed by metagenomic, metabolomic analysis, or by assessment of immunological parameters or intestinal permeability markers. Future research requires standardisation process starting from patient selection, material collection, DNA sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis. We did not observe whether antidepressive medications influence on gut microbiota, but the use of psychobiotics in patients with MDD has great prospects; however, this procedure requires also standardisation and thorough mechanistic research. The microbiota should be treated as an environmental element, which considers the aetiopathogenesis of the disease and provides new possibilities for monitoring and treating patients with MDD.},

  abstract = {Host genetics are known to influence the gut microbiome, yet their role remains poorly understood. To robustly characterize these effects, we performed a genome-wide association study of 207 taxa and 205 pathways representing microbial composition and function in 7,738 participants of the Dutch Microbiome Project. Two robust, study-wide significant (P\,{$<$}\,1.89\,{\texttimes}\,10-10) signals near the LCT and ABO genes were found to be associated with multiple microbial taxa and pathways and were replicated in two independent cohorts. The LCT locus associations seemed modulated by lactose intake, whereas those at ABO could be explained by participant secretor status determined by their FUT2 genotype. Twenty-two other loci showed suggestive evidence (P\,{$<$}\,5\,{\texttimes}\,10-8) of association with microbial taxa and pathways. At a more lenient threshold, the number of loci we identified strongly correlated with trait heritability, suggesting that much larger sample sizes are needed to elucidate the remaining effects of host genetics on the gut microbiome.},

  abstract = {It is challenging to associate features such as human health outcomes, diet, environmental conditions, or other metadata to microbial community measurements, due in part to their quantitative properties. Microbiome multi-omics are typically noisy, sparse (zero-inflated), high-dimensional, extremely non-normal, and often in the form of count or compositional measurements. Here we introduce an optimized combination of novel and established methodology to assess multivariable association of microbial community features with complex metadata in population-scale observational studies. Our approach, MaAsLin 2 (Microbiome Multivariable Associations with Linear Models), uses generalized linear and mixed models to accommodate a wide variety of modern epidemiological studies, including cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, as well as a variety of data types (e.g., counts and relative abundances) with or without covariates and repeated measurements. To construct this method, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of a broad range of scenarios under which straightforward identification of meta-omics associations can be challenging. These simulation studies reveal that MaAsLin 2's linear model preserves statistical power in the presence of repeated measures and multiple covariates, while accounting for the nuances of meta-omics features and controlling false discovery. We also applied MaAsLin 2 to a microbial multi-omics dataset from the Integrative Human Microbiome (HMP2) project which, in addition to reproducing established results, revealed a unique, integrated landscape of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) across multiple time points and omics profiles.},

However, the field is dominated by underpowered studies focusing on major depression not addressing microbiome functionality, compositional nature, or confounding factors. We applied a multi-omics approach combining pre-clinical models with three human cohorts including patients with mild depression. Microbial functions and metabolites converging onto glutamate/GABA metabolism, particularly proline, were linked to depression. High proline consumption was the dietary factor with the strongest impact on depression. Whole-brain dynamics revealed rich club network disruptions associated with depression and circulating proline. Proline supplementation in mice exacerbated depression along with microbial translocation. Human microbiota transplantation induced an emotionally impaired phenotype in mice and alterations in GABA-, proline-, and extracellular matrix-related prefrontal cortex genes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of proline and GABA transporters in Drosophila and mono-association with L.~plantarum, a high GABA producer, conferred protection against depression-like states. Targeting the microbiome and dietary proline may open new windows for efficient depression treatment.},

  abstract = {The emerging understanding of gut microbiota as `metabolic machinery' influencing many aspects of physiology has gained substantial attention in the field of psychiatry. This is largely due to the many overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms associated with both the potential functionality of the gut microbiota and the biological mechanisms thought to be underpinning mental disorders. In this systematic review, we synthesised the current literature investigating differences in gut microbiota composition in people with the major psychiatric disorders, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), compared to `healthy' controls. We also explored gut microbiota composition across disorders in an attempt to elucidate potential commonalities in the microbial signatures associated with these mental disorders. Following the PRISMA guidelines, databases were searched from inception through to December 2021. We identified 44 studies (including a total of 2510 psychiatric cases and 2407 controls) that met inclusion criteria, of which 24 investigated gut microbiota composition in MDD, seven investigated gut microbiota composition in BD, and 15 investigated gut microbiota composition in SZ. Our syntheses provide no strong evidence for a difference in the number or distribution ({$\alpha$}-diversity) of bacteria in those with a mental disorder compared to controls. However, studies were relatively consistent in reporting differences in overall community composition ({$\beta$}-diversity) in people with and without mental disorders. Our syntheses also identified specific bacterial taxa commonly associated with mental disorders, including lower levels of bacterial genera that produce short-chain fatty acids (e.g. butyrate), higher levels of lactic acid-producing bacteria, and higher levels of bacteria associated with glutamate and GABA metabolism. We also observed substantial heterogeneity across studies with regards to methodologies and reporting. Further prospective and experimental research using new tools and robust guidelines hold promise for improving our understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in mental and brain health and the development of interventions based on modification of gut microbiota.},

As a complete metagenomic analysis requires different tools for different purposes, the selection and setup of these tools remain challenging. Furthermore, the chosen toolset will affect the accuracy, the formatting, and the functional identifiers reported in the results, impacting the results interpretation and the biological answer obtained. Thus, we surveyed state-of-the-art tools available in the literature, created simulated datasets, and performed benchmarks to design a sensitive and flexible metagenomic analysis pipeline. Here we present MEDUSA, an efficient pipeline to conduct comprehensive metagenomic analyses. It performs preprocessing, assembly, alignment, taxonomic classification, and functional annotation on shotgun data, supporting user-built dictionaries to transfer annotations to any functional identifier. MEDUSA includes several tools, as fastp, Bowtie2, DIAMOND, Kaiju, MEGAHIT, and a novel tool implemented in Python to transfer annotations to BLAST/DIAMOND alignment results. These tools are installed via Conda, and the workflow is managed by Snakemake, easing the setup and execution. Compared with MEGAN 6 Community Edition, MEDUSA correctly identifies more species, especially the less abundant, and is more suited for functional analysis using Gene Ontology identifiers.},

  abstract = {Background Depression is a chronic syndrome with a pathogenesis linked to various genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Several links between gut microbiota and depression have been established in animal models. In humans, however, few correlations have yet been demonstrated. The aim of our work was therefore to identify potential correlations between human fecal microbiota (as a proxy for gut microbiota) and depression. Methods We analyzed fecal samples from 55 people, 37 patients, and 18 non-depressed controls. Our analyses were based on data generated by Illumina deep sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Key Results We found several correlations between depression and fecal microbiota. The correlations, however, showed opposite directions even for closely related Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU's), but were still associated with certain higher order phylogroups. The order Bacteroidales showed an overrepresentation (p = 0.05), while the family Lachnospiraceae showed an underrepresentation (p = 0.02) of OTU's associated with depression. At low taxonomic levels, there was one clade consisting of five OTU's within the genus Oscillibacter, and one clade within Alistipes (consisting of four OTU's) that showed a significant association with depression (p = 0.03 and 0.01, respectively). Conclusions \& Inferences The Oscillibacter type strain has valeric acid as its main metabolic end product, a homolog of neurotransmitter GABA, while Alistipes has previously been shown to be associated with induced stress in mice. In conclusion, the taxonomic correlations detected here may therefore correspond to mechanistic models.},

  abstract = {Emerging evidence has linked the gut microbiome changes to schizophrenia. However, there has been limited research into the functional pathways by which the gut microbiota contributes to the phenotype of persons with chronic schizophrenia. We characterized the composition and functional potential of the gut microbiota in 48 individuals with chronic schizophrenia and 48 matched (sequencing plate, age, sex, BMI, and antibiotic use) non-psychiatric comparison subjects (NCs) using 16S rRNA sequencing. Patients with schizophrenia demonstrated significant beta-diversity differences in microbial composition and predicted genetic functional potential compared to NCs. Alpha-diversity of taxa and functional pathways were not different between groups. Random forests analyses revealed that the microbiome predicts differentiation of patients with schizophrenia from NCs using taxa (75\% accuracy) and functional profiles (67\% accuracy for KEGG orthologs, 70\% for MetaCyc pathways). We utilized a new compositionally-aware method incorporating reference frames to identify differentially abundant microbes and pathways, which revealed that Lachnospiraceae is associated with schizophrenia. Functional pathways related to trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase and Kdo2-lipid A biosynthesis were altered in schizophrenia. These metabolic pathways were associated with inflammatory cytokines and risk for coronary heart disease in schizophrenia. Findings suggest potential mechanisms by which the microbiota may impact the pathophysiology of the disease through modulation of functional pathways related to immune signaling/response and lipid and glucose regulation to be further investigated in future studies.},

  abstract = {Evidence supports the observational associations of gut microbiota with a variety of psychiatric disorders, but the causal nature of such associations remains obscure. Aiming to comprehensively investigate their causal relationship and to identify specific causal microbe taxa for psychiatric diseases, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of gut microbiome with 15 psychiatric diseases. Specifically, the microbiome genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 18,473 individuals from the MiBioGen study was used as exposure sample, and the GWAS for 15 psychiatric diseases was used as outcome samples. One-hundred ninety bacterial taxa from six levels were available for analysis. At a multiple-testing corrected significance level (phylum P {$<$} 5.56 {\texttimes} 10--3, class P {$<$} 3.33 {\texttimes} 10--3, order P {$<$} 2.63 {\texttimes} 10--3, family P {$<$} 1.67 {\texttimes} 10--3, genus P {$<$} 4.90 {\texttimes} 10--4, and species P {$<$} 3.33 {\texttimes} 10--3), the following eight causal associations from seven bacterial features (one phylum + three classes + one order + one family + one species) were identified: family Prevotellaceae with autism spectrum disorder (P = 5.31 {\texttimes} 10--4), class Betaproteobacteria with bipolar disorder (P = 1.53 {\texttimes} 10--3), class Actinobacteria with schizophrenia (P = 1.33 {\texttimes} 10--3), class Bacteroidia and order Bacteroidales with Tourette syndrome (P = 2.51 {\texttimes} 10--3 and 2.51 {\texttimes} 10--3), phylum Actinobacteria and class Actinobacteria with extroversion (P = 8.22 {\texttimes} 10--4 and 1.09 {\texttimes} 10--3), and species Clostridium innocuum with neuroticism (P = 8.92 {\texttimes} 10--4).

Presently, gut-bacterial diversity, taxonomic abundance and metabolic bacterial pathways were compared across healthy young (n~=~22, 18--35 years), healthy older (n~=~33, 50--80 years), and PD groups (n~=~18, 50--80 years) using shotgun sequencing and compositional data analysis. Associations between the gut-microbiome and PD symptoms, and between lifestyle factors (fibre intake, physical activity, and sleep) and the gut-microbiome were conducted. Alpha-diversity did not differ between PD participants and older adults, whilst beta-diversity differed between these groups. Lower abundance of Butyricimonas synergistica, a butyrate-producer, was associated with worse PD non-motor symptoms in the PD group. Regarding typical ageing, Bifidobacterium bifidum, was greater in the younger compared to older group, with no difference between the older and PD group. Abundance of metabolic pathways related to butyrate production did not differ among the groups, while other metabolic pathways differed among the three groups. Sleep efficiency was positively associated with Roseburia inulinivorans in the older group. These results highlight the relevance of gut-microbiota to PD and that reduced butyrate-production may be involved with PD pathophysiology.

  abstract = {Some amino acids act as neurotransmitters themselves, or are precursors of neurotransmitters. Previous studies reported inconsistent results regarding their changes in blood in major depressive disorder (MDD), which prompted us to examine plasma levels of amino acids and related molecules in two independent case-control sample sets. In total, 511 subjects were recruited. Sample set A consisted of 164 patients with MDD (147 currently depressed [dMDD]; 17 in remission, DSM-IV) and 217 healthy controls. Sample set B consisted of 65 patients (51 dMDD; 14 in remission) and 65 controls. Plasma amino acid levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography for set A and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry for set B. We further analyzed the relationships between plasma amino acid levels and clinical variables. In sample set A, plasma asparagine, histidine+1-methylhistidine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine levels were decreased, while plasma glutamate and phosphoethanolamine were elevated in dMDD compared to controls (all P~{$<~$}0.0005), even after correcting for multiple testing. Plasma leucine levels were associated with ``psychic anxiety.'' In sample set B, glutamate and methionine levels were also altered in the same direction to that in sample set A (both P~{$<~$}0.05). In the integrative analysis, plasma glutamate and methionine levels were found to be significantly associated with the diagnosis of MDD with small to medium effect sizes (both P~{$<~$}1.0E-6). In conclusion, several amino acids and related molecules were altered in patients with MDD. Decreased methionine and increased glutamate levels were found consistently in the two sample sets, suggesting their involvement in MDD. Further investigations are warranted on the possible role of amino acids in the pathophysiology of MDD.},

Heritability of MDD is estimated around 40\%, suggesting that genotyping is a promising field for research into the development of MDD. According to the dopamine theory of affective disorders, a deficiency in dopaminergic neurotransmission may play a role in the major symptoms of MDD. Specific polymorphisms in genes that affect dopamine transmission could increase susceptibility to MDD. To determine the extent to which these genes influence vulnerability to MDD, we discuss genes for crucial steps in dopamine neurotransmission: synthesis, signalling and inactivation. The val158met polymorphism of the COMT gene exemplifies the lack of consensus in the literature: although it is one of the most reported polymorphisms that relates to MDD vulnerability, its role is not corroborated by meta-analysis. Gene--gene interactions and gene--environment interactions provide more explanatory potential than single gene associations. Two notable exceptions are the DRD4 and DAT gene: both have variable tandem repeat polymorphisms which may have a ``single gene'' influence on susceptibility to MDD.},

Levels of CRP (g~=~0.71; 95\%CI: 0.50--0.92; p~{$<~$}0.0001); IL-3 (g~=~0.60; 95\%CI: 0.31--0.89; p~{$<~$}0.0001); IL-6 (g~=~0.61; 95\%CI: 0.39--0.82; p~{$<~$}0.0001); IL-12 (g~=~1.18; 95\%CI: 0.74--1.62; p~{$<~$}0.0001); IL-18 (g~=~1.97; 95\%CI: 1.00--2.95; p~{$<~$}0.0001); sIL-2R (g~=~0.71; 95\%CI: 0.44--0.98; p~{$<~$}0.0001); and TNF{$\alpha$} (g~=~0.54; 95\%CI: 0.32--0.76; p~{$<~$}0.0001) were significantly higher in patients with depression. These findings were robust to a range of potential confounds and moderators. Mean-scaled variability, measured as CVR, was significantly lower in patients with depression for CRP (CVR~=~0.85; 95\%CI: 0.75--0.98; p~=~0.02); IL-12 (CVR~=~0.61; 95\%CI: 0.46--0.80; p~{$<~$}0.01); and sIL-2R (CVR~=~0.85; 95\%CI: 0.73--0.99; p~=~0.04), while it was unchanged for IL-3, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF {$\alpha$}. Conclusions and Relevance Depression is confirmed as a pro-inflammatory state. Some of the inflammatory markers elevated in depression, including CRP and IL-12, show reduced variability in patients with depression, therefore supporting greater homogeneity in terms of an inflammatory phenotype in depression. Some inflammatory marker elevations in depression do not appear due to an inflamed sub-group, but rather to a right shift of the immune marker distribution.},

  abstract = {The study of the gut microbiome has increasingly revealed an important role in modulating brain function and mental health. In this review, we underscore specific pathways and mechanisms by which the gut microbiome can promote the development of mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. First, we review the involvement of the stress response and immune system activation in the development of depression and anxiety. Then, we examine germ-free murine models used to uncover the role of the gut microbiome in developing and modulating pertinent activity in the brain and the immune system. We also document multiple pathways by which stress-induced inflammation harms brain function and ultimately affects mental health, and review how probiotic and prebiotic treatments have shown to be beneficial. Lastly, we provide an overview of gut microbiome-derived compounds (short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan catabolites, microbial pattern recognition) and related mechanisms (vagal nerve activity and fecal microbiota transplants) involved in mediating the influence of the gut microbiome to mental health. Overall, a picture of the gut microbiome playing a facilitating role between stress response, inflammation, and depression, and anxiety is emerging. Future research is needed to firmly establish the microbiome's causal role, to further elucidate the mechanisms by which gut microbes influence brain function and mental health, and to possibly develop treatments that improve mental health through microbiotic targets.},

  abstract = {Accumulating evidence indicates the potential effect of microbiota on the pathogenesis and course of schizophrenia. However, the effects of olanzapine, second-generation antipsychotics, on gut microbiota have not been investigated in humans. This study aimed to analyze fecal microbiota in schizophrenia patients treated with olanzapine during six weeks of their hospital stay. After a seven-day washout from all psychotropic medications, microbiota compositions were evaluated at baseline and after six weeks of hospitalization using 16S rRNA sequencing. The study was conducted in 20 inpatients, who followed the same hospital routine and received 5--20 mg daily doses of olanzapine. Olanzapine treatment was associated with clinical improvements in all patients and significant increases in body mass index in females, but not changes in gut microbiota compositions and predicted function. The severity of symptoms at the beginning of treatment varied in accordance with the predicted metabolic activity of the bacteria. The present findings indicate that the microbiota of schizophrenia patients is highly individual and has different taxonomical (Type 1, with a predominance of Prevotella, and Type 2 with a higher abundance of Bacteroides, Blautia and Clostridium) and functional clusters, and it does not change following six weeks of olanzapine therapy; in addition, the microbiota is not associated with either the weight gain observed in women or the effectiveness of olanzapine therapy.},

We identify association of thirteen microbial taxa, including genera Eggerthella, Subdoligranulum, Coprococcus, Sellimonas, Lachnoclostridium, Hungatella, Ruminococcaceae (UCG002, UCG003 and UCG005), LachnospiraceaeUCG001, Eubacterium ventriosum and Ruminococcusgauvreauiigroup, and family Ruminococcaceae with depressive symptoms. These bacteria are known to be involved in the synthesis of glutamate, butyrate, serotonin and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), which are key neurotransmitters for depression. Our study suggests that~the gut microbiome composition may play a key role in depression.},

  abstract = {Background: To probe the differences of gut microbiota among major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder with current major depressive episode (BPD) and health participants. Methods: Thirty one MDD patients, thirty BPD patients, and thirty healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. All the faecal samples were analyzed by shotgun metagenomics sequencing. Except for routine analyses of alpha diversity, we specially designed a new indicator, the G m coefficient, to evaluate the inequality of relative abundances of microbiota for each participant. Results: The G m coefficients are significant decreased in both MDD and BPD groups. The relative abundances of increased phyla Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and decreased Bacteroidetes were significantly in the MDD and BPD groups. At genus level, four of top five enriched genera (Bacteroides, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Oscillibacter and Streptococcus) were found increased significantly in the MDD and BPD groups compared with HCs. The genera Escherichia and Klebsiella showed significant changes in abundances only between the BPD and HC groups. At the species level, compared with BPD patients, MDD patients had a higher abundance of Prevotellaceae including Prevotella denticola F0289, Prevotella intermedia 17, Prevotella ruminicola, and Prevotella intermedia. Furthermore, the abundance of Fusobacteriaceae, Escherichia blattae DSM 4481 and Klebsiella oxytoca were significantly increased, whereas the Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697 = JCM 1222 was significantly reduced in BPD group compared with MDD group. Conclusions: Our study suggested that gut microbiota may be involved in the pathogenesis of both MDD and BPD patients, and the nuances of bacteria may have the potentiality of being the biomarkers of MDD and BPD.},

  abstract = {Background Interactions between the digestive system and the brain functions have become in recent years an important field of psychiatric research. These multidirectional interactions take place in the so called microbiota-gut-brain axis and emerging scientific data indicate to the significant role of microbiota in the modulation of the central nervous system (CNS) including affective and cognitive functions. Objective An assessment of psychobiotic and immunomodulatory effects of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus Plantarum 299v (LP299v) by measuring affective, cognitive functions and biochemical parameters in patients with MDD undergoing treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Design Seventy nine patients with MDD were randomized and allocated to a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants received either a SSRI with the probiotic LP299v (n\,=\,40) for a period of 8 weeks or a SSRI with the placebo of the probiotic (n\,=\,39) for the same period. The severity of psychiatric symptoms was assessed using Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D 17), Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Cognitive functions were assessed using the Attention and Perceptivity Test (APT), Stroop Test parts A and B, Ruff Figural Fluency Test (RFFT), Trail Making Test (TMT) Parts A and B and the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Biochemical parameters such as tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HKYN), anthranilic acid (AA), 3-hydroxy anthranilic acid (3HAA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-{$\alpha$}), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1-beta (IL-1b) and cortisol plasma concentrations were measured. Results Sixty participants finished the study and were analyzed: 30 participants in the LP299v group and 30 participants in the placebo group. There was an improvement in APT and in CVLT total recall of trials 1--5 in the LP299v group compared with the placebo between baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention. There was a significant decrease in KYN concentration in the LP299v group compared to the placebo group. We also observed significant increase in 3HKYN:KYN ratio in the LP299v group compared with the placebo group. Additionally, Repeated Measures ANOVA revealed a significant effect of interaction of Treatment x time for AA concentration. However, results of post hoc analysis did not reach statistical significance in neither probiotic nor placebo group. There were no significant changes of TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-6 and IL-1b and cortisol concentrations in neither probiotic nor placebo groups. Conclusions Augmentation of SSRI treatment with probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus Plantarum 299v improved cognitive performance and decreased KYN concentration in MDD patients. Decreased KYN concentration could contribute to the improvement of cognitive functions in the LP299v group compared to the placebo group. To our knowledge results of this study are the first evidence of improvement of cognitive functions in MDD patients due to probiotic bacteria and this is the first evidence of decreased KYN concentration in MDD patients due to probiotic bacteria.},

  abstract = {There are marked sex differences in the prevalence, phenotypic presentation and treatment response for major depression. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) adjust for sex differences, to date, no studies seek to identify sex-specific markers and pathways. In this study, we performed a sex-stratified genome-wide association analysis for broad depression with the UK Biobank total participants (N\,=\,274,141), including only non-related participants, as well as with males (N\,=\,127,867) and females (N\,=\,146,274) separately. Bioinformatics analyses were performed to characterize common and sex-specific markers and associated processes/pathways. We identified 11 loci passing genome-level significance (P\,{$<$}\,5\,{\texttimes}\,10-8) in females and one in males. In both males and females, genetic correlations were significant between the broad depression GWA and other psychopathologies; however, correlations with educational attainment and metabolic features including body fat, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio and triglycerides were significant only in females. Gene-based analysis showed 147 genes significantly associated with broad depression in the total sample, 64 in the females and 53 in the males. Gene-based analysis revealed ``Regulation of Gene Expression'' as a common biological process, but suggested sex-specific molecular mechanisms. Finally, sex-specific polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for broad depression outperformed total and the opposite sex PRSs in the prediction of broad major depressive disorder. These findings provide evidence for sex-dependent genetic pathways for clinical depression as well as for health conditions comorbid with depression.},

We present the first systematic review of the gut microbiota in anxiety disorders, along with an update in depression. Consideration of shared underlying features is essential due to the high rates of comorbidity. Systematic searches, following PRISMA guidelines, identified 26 studies (two case-control comparisons of the gut microbiota in generalised anxiety disorder, 18 in depression, one incorporating both anxiety/depression, and five including symptom-only measures). Alpha and beta diversity findings were inconsistent; however, differences in bacterial taxa indicated disorders may be characterised by a higher abundance of proinflammatory species (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae and Desulfovibrio), and lower short-chain fatty acid producing-bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium). Several taxa, and their mechanisms of action, may relate to anxiety and depression pathophysiology via communication of peripheral inflammation to the brain.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}One of the major methods to identify microbial community composition, to unravel microbial population dynamics, and to explore microbial diversity in environmental samples is high-throughput DNA- or RNA-based 16S rRNA (gene) amplicon sequencing in combination with bioinformatics analyses. However, focusing on environmental samples from contrasting habitats, it was not systematically evaluated (i) which analysis methods provide results that reflect reality most accurately, (ii) how the interpretations of microbial community studies are biased by different analysis methods and (iii) if the most optimal analysis workflow can be implemented in an easy-to-use pipeline. Here, we compared the performance of 16S rRNA (gene) amplicon sequencing analysis tools (i.e., Mothur, QIIME1, QIIME2, and MEGAN) using three mock datasets with known microbial community composition that differed in sequencing quality, species number and abundance distribution (i.e., even or uneven), and phylogenetic diversity (i.e., closely related or well-separated amplicon sequences). Our results showed that QIIME2 outcompeted all other investigated tools in sequence recovery (\&gt;10 times fewer false positives), taxonomic assignments (\&gt;22\% better F-score) and diversity estimates (\&gt;5\% better assessment), suggesting that this approach is able to reflect the {$<$}italic{$>$}in situ{$<$}/italic{$>$} microbial community most accurately. Further analysis of 24 environmental datasets obtained from four contrasting terrestrial and freshwater sites revealed dramatic differences in the resulting microbial community composition for all pipelines at genus level. For instance, at the investigated river water sites {$<$}italic{$>$}Sphaerotilus{$<$}/italic{$>$} was only reported when using QIIME1 (8\% abundance) and {$<$}italic{$>$}Agitococcus{$<$}/italic{$>$} with QIIME1 or QIIME2 (2 or 3\% abundance, respectively), but both genera remained undetected when analyzed with Mothur or MEGAN. Since these abundant taxa probably have implications for important biogeochemical cycles (e.g., nitrate and sulfate reduction) at these sites, their detection and semi-quantitative enumeration is crucial for valid interpretations. A high-performance computing conformant workflow was constructed to allow FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable) 16S rRNA (gene) amplicon sequence analysis starting from raw sequence files, using the most optimal methods identified in our study. Our presented workflow should be considered for future studies, thereby facilitating the analysis of high-throughput 16S rRNA (gene) sequencing data substantially, while maximizing reliability and confidence in microbial community data analysis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A transcriptome-wide investigation was performed in 165 acutely infected hospitalized individuals who were followed clinically into the post-acute period. Distinct gene expression signatures of post-acute sequelae were already present in whole blood during acute infection, with innate and adaptive immune cells implicated in different symptoms. Two clusters of sequelae exhibited divergent plasma-cell-associated gene expression patterns. In one cluster, sequelae associated with higher expression of immunoglobulin-related genes in an anti-spike antibody titer-dependent manner. In the other, sequelae associated independently of these titers with lower expression of immunoglobulin-related genes, indicating lower non-specific antibody production in individuals with these sequelae. This relationship between lower total immunoglobulins and sequelae was validated in an external cohort. Altogether, multiple etiologies of post-acute sequelae were already detectable during SARS-CoV-2 infection, directly linking these sequelae with the acute host response to the virus and providing early insights into their development.},

Here we use factor analysis and genomic structural equation modelling to investigate the genetic factor structure underlying 28 items assessing depression, anxiety and neuroticism, a closely related personality trait. Symptoms of depression and anxiety loaded on two distinct, although highly genetically correlated factors, and neuroticism items were partitioned between them. We used this factor structure to conduct genome-wide association analyses on latent factors of depressive symptoms (89 independent variants, 61 genomic loci) and anxiety symptoms (102 variants, 73 loci) in the UK Biobank. Of these associated variants, 72\% and 78\%, respectively, replicated in an independent cohort of approximately 1.9 million individuals with self-reported diagnosis of depression and anxiety. We use these results to characterize shared and trait-specific genetic associations. Our findings provide insight into the genetic architecture of depression and anxiety and comorbidity between them.},

  abstract = {The relationship between gut microbial metabolism and mental health is one of the most intriguing and controversial topics in microbiome research. Bidirectional microbiota--gut--brain communication has mostly been explored in animal models, with human research lagging behind. Large-scale metagenomics studies could facilitate the translational process, but their interpretation is hampered by a lack of dedicated reference databases and tools to study the microbial neuroactive potential. Surveying a large microbiome population cohort (Flemish Gut Flora Project, n\,=\,1,054) with validation in independent data sets (ntotal\,=\,1,070), we studied how microbiome features correlate with host quality of life and depression. Butyrate-producing Faecalibacterium and Coprococcus bacteria were consistently associated with higher quality of life indicators. Together with Dialister, Coprococcus spp. were also depleted in depression, even after correcting for the confounding effects of antidepressants. Using a module-based analytical framework, we assembled a catalogue of neuroactive potential of sequenced gut prokaryotes. Gut--brain module analysis of faecal metagenomes identified the microbial synthesis potential of the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid as correlating positively with mental quality of life and indicated a potential role of microbial {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid production in depression. Our results provide population-scale evidence for microbiome links to mental health, while emphasizing confounder importance.},

  abstract = {The gut microbiota is now considered as one of the key elements contributing to the regulation of host health. Virtually all our body sites are colonised by microbes suggesting different types of crosstalk with our organs. Because of the development of molecular tools and techniques (ie, metagenomic, metabolomic, lipidomic, metatranscriptomic), the complex interactions occurring between the host and the different microorganisms are progressively being deciphered. Nowadays, gut microbiota deviations are linked with many diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis, intestinal bowel diseases (IBDs) and several types of cancer. Thus, suggesting that various pathways involved in immunity, energy, lipid and glucose metabolism are affected. In this review, specific attention is given to provide a critical evaluation of the current understanding in this field. Numerous molecular mechanisms explaining how gut bacteria might be causally linked with the protection or the onset of diseases are discussed. We examine well-established metabolites (ie, short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, trimethylamine N-oxide) and extend this to more recently identified molecular actors (ie, endocannabinoids, bioactive lipids, phenolic-derived compounds, advanced glycation end products and enterosynes) and their specific receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR{$\alpha$}) and gamma (PPAR{$\gamma$}), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and G protein-coupled receptors (ie, GPR41, GPR43, GPR119, Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5). Altogether, understanding the complexity and the molecular aspects linking gut microbes to health will help to set the basis for novel therapies that are already being developed.},

  abstract = {Metagenomics is a discipline that enables the genomic study of uncultured microorganisms. Faster, cheaper sequencing technologies and the ability to sequence uncultured microbes sampled directly from their habitats are expanding and transforming our view of the microbial world. Distilling meaningful information from the millions of new genomic sequences presents a serious challenge to bioinformaticians. In cultured microbes, the genomic data come from a single clone, making sequence assembly and annotation tractable. In metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous microbial communities, sometimes containing more than 10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and partial. From sampling, to assembly, to gene calling and function prediction, bioinformatics faces new demands in interpreting voluminous, noisy, and often partial sequence data. Although metagenomics is a relative newcomer to science, the past few years have seen an explosion in computational methods applied to metagenomic-based research. It is therefore not within the scope of this article to provide an exhaustive review. Rather, we provide here a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the current computational requirements presented by metagenomics, and review the recent progress made. We also note whether there is software that implements any of the methods presented here, and briefly review its utility. Nevertheless, it would be useful if readers of this article would avail themselves of the comment section provided by this journal, and relate their own experiences. Finally, the last section of this article provides a few representative studies illustrating different facets of recent scientific discoveries made using metagenomics.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common illness accompanied by considerable morbidity, mortality, costs, and heightened risk of suicide. We conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis based in 135,458 cases and 344,901 controls and identified 44 independent and significant loci. The genetic findings were associated with clinical features of major depression and implicated brain regions exhibiting anatomical differences in cases. Targets of antidepressant medications and genes involved in gene splicing were enriched for smaller association signal. We found important relationships of genetic risk for major depression with educational attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia: lower educational attainment and higher body mass were putatively causal, whereas major depression and schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological etiology. All humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors for major depression. These findings help refine the basis of major depression and imply that a continuous measure of risk underlies the clinical phenotype.},

  abstract = {Shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis is widely used for microbial profiling of biological specimens and pathogen detection. However, very little is known about the technical biases caused by the choice of analysis software and databases on the biological specimen. In this study, we evaluated different direct read shotgun metagenomics taxonomic profiling software to characterize the microbial compositions of simulated mice gut microbiome samples and of biological samples collected from wild rodents across multiple taxonomic levels. Using ten of the most widely used metagenomics software and four different databases, we demonstrated that obtaining an accurate species-level microbial profile using the current direct read metagenomics profiling software is still a challenging task. We also showed that the discrepancies in results when different databases and software were used could lead to significant variations in the distinct microbial taxa classified, in the characterizations of the microbial communities, and in the differentially abundant taxa identified. Differences in database contents and read profiling algorithms are the main contributors for these discrepancies. The inclusion of host genomes and of genomes of the interested taxa in the databases is important for increasing the accuracy of profiling. Our analysis also showed that software included in this study differed in their ability to detect the presence of Leptospira, a major zoonotic pathogen of one health importance, especially at the species level resolution. We concluded that using different databases and software combinations can result in confounding biological conclusions in microbial profiling. Our study warrants that software and database selection must be based on the purpose of the study.},

  abstract = {Microbiome research is now moving beyond the compositional analysis of microbial taxa in a sample. Increasing evidence from large human microbiome studies suggests that functional consequences of changes in the intestinal microbiome may provide more power for studying their impact on inflammation and immune responses. Although 16S rRNA analysis is one of the most popular and a cost-effective method to profile the microbial compositions, marker-gene sequencing cannot provide direct information about the functional genes that are present in the genomes of community members. Bioinformatic tools have been developed to predict microbiome function with 16S rRNA gene data. Among them, PICRUSt2 (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) has become one of the most popular functional profile prediction tools, which generates community-wide pathway abundances. However, no state-of-art inference tools are available to test the differences in pathway abundances between comparison groups. We have developed ggpicrust2, an R package, for analyzing functional profiles derived from 16S rRNA sequencing. This powerful tool enables researchers to conduct extensive differential abundance analyses and generate visually appealing visualizations that effectively highlight functional signals. With ggpicrust2, users can obtain publishable results and gain deeper insights into the functional composition of their microbial communities.The package is open-source under the MIT and file license and is available at CRAN and https://github.com/cafferychen777/ggpicrust2.

  abstract = {Objectives Approximately one-third of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients do not respond to standard antidepressants and develop treatment-resistant depression (TRD). We aimed to reveal metabolic differences and discover promising potential biomarkers in TRD. Methods Our study recruited 108 participants including healthy controls (n~=~40) and patients with TRD (n~=~35) and first-episode drug-naive MDD (DN-MDD) (n~=~33). Plasma samples were presented to ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Then, a machine-learning algorithm was conducted to facilitate the selection of potential biomarkers. Results TRD appeared to be a distinct metabolic disorder from DN-MDD and healthy controls (HCs). Compared to HCs, 199 and 176 differentially expressed metabolites were identified in TRD and DN-MDD, respectively. Of all the metabolites that were identified, spermine, spermidine, and carnosine were considered the most promising biomarkers for diagnosing TRD and DN-MDD patients, with the resulting area under the ROC curve of 0.99, 0.99, and 0.93, respectively. Metabolic pathway analysis yielded compelling evidence of marked changes or imbalances in both polyamine metabolism and energy metabolism, which could potentially represent the primary altered pathways associated with MDD. Additionally, L-glutamine, Beta-alanine, and spermine were correlated with HAMD score. Conclusions A more disordered metabolism structure is found in TRD than in DN-MDD and HCs. Future investigations should prioritize the comprehensive analysis of potential roles played by these differential metabolites and disturbances in polyamine pathways in the pathophysiology of TRD and depression.},

It often remains unclear whether the risk factors are cause or consequence of disease, or whether the associations are the result of confounding. We develop and apply a method (called GSMR) that performs a multi-SNP Mendelian randomization analysis using summary-level data from genome-wide association studies to test the causal associations of BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, serum cholesterols, blood pressures, height, and years of schooling (EduYears) with common diseases (sample sizes of up to 405,072). We identify a number of causal associations including a protective effect of LDL-cholesterol against type-2 diabetes (T2D) that might explain the side effects of statins on T2D, a protective effect of EduYears against Alzheimer's disease, and bidirectional associations with opposite effects (e.g., higher BMI increases the risk of T2D but the effect of T2D on BMI is negative).},

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization and colocalization are two statistical approaches that can be applied to summarized data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to understand relationships between traits and diseases. However, despite similarities in scope, they are different in their objectives, implementation, and interpretation, in part because they were developed to serve different scientific communities. Mendelian randomization assesses whether genetic predictors of an exposure are associated with the outcome and interprets an association as evidence that the exposure has a causal effect on the outcome, whereas colocalization assesses whether two traits are affected by the same or distinct causal variants. When considering genetic variants in a single genetic region, both approaches can be performed. While a positive colocalization finding typically implies a non-zero Mendelian randomization estimate, the reverse is not generally true: there are several scenarios which would lead to a non-zero Mendelian randomization estimate but lack evidence for colocalization. These include the existence of distinct but correlated causal variants for the exposure and outcome, which would violate the Mendelian randomization assumptions, and a lack of strong associations with the outcome. As colocalization was developed in the GWAS tradition, typically evidence for colocalization is concluded only when there is strong evidence for associations with both traits. In contrast, a non-zero estimate from Mendelian randomization can be obtained despite only nominally significant genetic associations with the outcome at the locus. In this review, we discuss how the two approaches can provide complementary information on potential therapeutic targets.},
